# altitude of the shuttle. Each iteration, decrease the 
# fuel level by 100 units for each astronaut aboard. Also, 
# increase the altitude by 50 kilometers.

# The shuttle gained an altitude of ___ km and has ___ kg 
# of fuel left. Fill in the blanks with the altitude and

#  Otherwise add, “Failed to reach orbit.”
