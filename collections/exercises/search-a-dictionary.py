## Set a variable called choice to the flavor you want to search for.

## Use an if statement to check if choice is in the flavors dictionary.
if choice in  flavors:

## If it is, set another variable called cost to the value associated with choice.
cost = flavors[choice]

## If it isn’t, set cost to 0.
else:

## Print the cost.

### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.
highest_cost = 0
fanciest = ""

## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.
for flavor in flavors:
   
## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.
 if flavors[flavor] > highest_cost:
    
## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.
 fanciest = flavor
 highest_cost = flavors[flavor]

## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.
highest_cost = 0
fanciest = ""

for flavor in flavors:
    if flavors[flavor] > highest_cost:
        fanciest = flavor
        highest_cost = flavors[flavor]
print('The fanciest flavor is', fanciest, 'and it costs', highest_cost)
